Roadmap for Multi-Service Travel API
This document outlines the development phases and key milestones for building a multi-service Travel API with microservices architecture. Each phase has detailed tasks to ensure end-to-end delivery of a robust, secure, and scalable API.

Phase 1: Initial Setup & Project Structure
Goal: Establish the foundational project structure, code repositories, and CI/CD workflows.

 Define Folder Structure:

✓ Set up /services directory with each microservice (e.g., flight_service, hotel_service, car_service).
✓ Include shared components in /shared (e.g., auth, logging, caching).
✓ Set up /api_gateway for centralized routing and handling of requests.
✓ Create initial Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for local development.

Repository Management:
- Choose repository structure:
    - Mono-repo advantages:
        - Easier code sharing and dependency management
        - Simplified CI/CD coordination
        - Atomic commits across services
        - Centralized versioning
    - Multi-repo advantages:
        - Clear service boundaries
        - Independent deployment cycles
        - Better access control per service
        - Smaller, more focused codebases
    ➜ Decision needed: Choose based on team size and service coupling

- Configure Git workflow:
    - Main branches:
        - main/master (production)
        - develop (integration)
        - feature/* (new features)
        - hotfix/* (urgent fixes)
        - release/* (release candidates)
    - Protection rules:
        - Require pull request reviews
        - Enforce status checks
        - No direct pushes to main/develop
    - Commit message standards:
        - Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
        - Include ticket/issue references

- Version control strategy:
    - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
    - Tag releases with v{version} (e.g., v1.0.0)
    - Maintain CHANGELOG.md per service
    - Document breaking changes

Setup CI/CD:
- Implement GitHub Actions/CircleCI:
    - Create workflow files per service
    - Define build matrix for different environments
    - Set up automated testing:
        - Unit tests
        - Integration tests
        - Linting
        - Security scans
    - Configure environment secrets
    - Add status badges to README

- Docker image management:
    - Set up automated builds
    - Tag images with:
        - Git SHA
        - Semantic version
        - Environment (dev/staging/prod)
    - Configure registry authentication
    - Implement vulnerability scanning
    - Set up image cleanup policies

Step 2: Configure Docker for Local Development
Write Dockerfiles for each microservice (you can start with a basic FastAPI Dockerfile).
Create a docker-compose.yml file to run services locally.
Test that all services build and run correctly in Docker.

Phase 2: Core Microservices Development
✓ Goal: Develop each core microservice (e.g., Flights, Hotels, Car Rentals) to interface with existing enterprise-level API services, implementing necessary business logic and data transformation.

Develop Flight Service:

✓ Implement FastAPI app with endpoints for searching and booking flights.
✓ Create adapters to interface with the existing enterprise flight API.
✓ Implement any necessary data transformation or business logic.
✓ Add unit tests for core functionality and API integration.

Develop Hotel Service:

Create endpoints for hotel search and booking, interfacing with the enterprise hotel API.
Implement business logic for handling rates, availability, and room types if not provided by the enterprise API.
Add integration tests and mock enterprise API calls for testing.

 Other Core Services:

Repeat the above structure for Holiday, Car, Bus, Train, Insurance, and Event services.
Ensure each service properly interfaces with its corresponding enterprise API.
Implement any service-specific business logic or data transformation needed.

 API Integration Layer:

Develop a shared library or module for handling authentication and communication with enterprise APIs.
✓- Create an `APIClient` class with methods for different HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
✓- Implement OAuth2 authentication flow for enterprise APIs that require it.
    - Create an `OAuth2Client` class to handle the OAuth2 flow.
    - Implement methods for obtaining and refreshing access tokens.
    - Store tokens securely using environment variables or a secrets manager.
    - Add token expiration handling and automatic refresh mechanism.
    - Integrate OAuth2 authentication with the existing `APIClient` class.
✓- Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager for storing API keys and tokens.

Implement retry logic and error handling for enterprise API calls:
- Use exponential backoff strategy for retries:
    - Start with a base delay (e.g., 1 second)
    - Double delay after each retry attempt
    - Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd
    - Set maximum delay cap
- Set maximum retry attempts and timeout limits:
    - Configure per-request timeouts
    - Set global timeout limits
    - Define retry-able HTTP status codes
    - Handle idempotency for POST/PUT requests
- Log detailed error information for debugging and monitoring:
    - Include request/response details
    - Log stack traces for exceptions
    - Add correlation IDs for request tracking
    - Monitor retry attempts and failure rates

Create standardized response formats across all services.
- Define a common response structure (e.g., {status, data, errors}).
- Implement error codes and messages that are consistent across services.
- Ensure all API responses follow this format, including successful and error responses.

Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.
- Use a token bucket algorithm or similar for rate limiting.
- Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent overloading enterprise APIs.

Create comprehensive documentation for the integration layer.
- Document all available methods, their parameters, and return values.
- Provide usage examples for common scenarios.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with each change or addition to the integration layer.

 Caching Strategy:

Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce load on enterprise APIs and improve response times.
Define cache invalidation strategies based on data volatility and API update frequencies.

 Error Handling and Logging:

Implement comprehensive error handling for both internal errors and enterprise API failures.
Set up detailed logging for tracking requests, responses, and any issues with enterprise API integration.

Phase 3: API Gateway & Routing
Goal: Create a centralized API gateway to handle routing, authentication, rate limiting, and request validation.

 Configure API Gateway:

Implement routing to each service based on URLs (e.g., /flights, /hotels).
Add rate-limiting middleware and configure thresholds.
 Set Up Authentication:

Use OAuth2.0 and JWT for secure token-based access.
Enable token validation at the gateway level.
 Implement Caching:

Add Redis caching at the gateway level for popular queries.
Implement cache expiration and invalidation logic.
Phase 4: Messaging & Event-Driven Communication
Goal: Establish asynchronous communication between services using RabbitMQ or Kafka to ensure decoupling and event-driven architecture.

 Set Up Messaging System:

Implement RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle events between services.
Create message models in /shared/messages for each event type (e.g., BookingConfirmed, PaymentProcessed).
 Integrate with Core Services:

Set up event listeners and producers in each service (e.g., booking event triggers notification service).
Test event-driven interactions with message queue.
Phase 5: Observability & Monitoring
Goal: Ensure visibility into system performance, health, and usage metrics with logging, tracing, and monitoring tools.

 Centralized Logging:

Set up the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki for log aggregation.
Configure structured logging across all services.
 Distributed Tracing:

Implement OpenTelemetry or Jaeger for tracing requests through services.
Enable tracing at the API gateway for complete request lifecycle visibility.
 Metrics & Alerts:

Use Prometheus to collect metrics from services.
Set up Grafana dashboards and configure alerting for critical metrics.
Phase 6: Security & Fault Tolerance
Goal: Strengthen security and resilience across services with circuit breakers, rate limiting, and automated testing.

 Enhance Authentication & Authorization:

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within services.
Integrate OAuth2.0 and JWT token expiration with automatic refresh.
 Add Circuit Breakers and Retry Logic:

Use Resilience4j or a similar library to prevent cascading failures.
Set up retry policies with exponential backoff for critical operations.
 Secrets Management:

Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for secure storage of secrets.
Update each service to fetch secrets at runtime.
Phase 7: Deployment & Scalability
Goal: Deploy services in a scalable Kubernetes environment with high availability and load balancing.

 Containerize All Services:

Ensure Dockerfiles are optimized for each microservice.
Use multi-stage builds to keep images lightweight.
 Kubernetes Setup:

Deploy each microservice with Kubernetes deployments and services.
Configure HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for auto-scaling based on demand.
 Load Balancing & Service Discovery:

Use Consul or Eureka for service discovery.
Set up load balancing using NGINX, Kong, or Traefik at the API Gateway.
Phase 8: Testing & Quality Assurance
Goal: Validate the functionality, performance, and resilience of the entire system.

 Comprehensive Testing:

Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for each service.
Use load testing tools (e.g., Locust) to evaluate service performance.
 Compliance & Security Audits:

Run security tests, including static analysis, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.
Address any issues identified during testing.
 Code Review & Documentation:

Conduct code reviews with peers for quality assurance.
Document architecture, API specs, and deployment steps.
Phase 9: Go Live & Post-Deployment Monitoring
Goal: Ensure stable production release, monitor for issues, and iterate based on feedback.
